# 'I want to know what I am doing' guide
__Important:__ Unfortunately, ezOVPN needs to be executed as root, because it is interacting with the OpenVPN CLI, which creates a TUN/TAP interface and a local TCP server called [Management Interface](https://openvpn.net/community-resources/management-interface/). 

__ezOVPN is still an unstable and unsecure software, so please be careful and don't use this software, unless you operate on a safe environment. Keep in mind, that you use this software at your own risk. I don't give any warartny__
